# Multithreaded Software-Raytracer
This project is an extention of a school project I made for the Graphics Programming 1 course during my studios at Howest University - Digital Arts & Entertainment.

For the school assignment I made the raytracer itself. But when I was creating SJSL (Simple Job System Library) I extended this project to test my jobsystem to divide the rendering of a frame automatically across different threads.
